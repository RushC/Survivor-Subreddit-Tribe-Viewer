# Survivor-Subreddit-Tribe-Viewer

This chrome extension will keep track of which users are on which tribe on [/r/Survivor](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/).

The extension works by collecting a list of users on each page you visit on /r/Survivor and sorting each into a tribe based on the first
letter of their username. Once that is finished, the list of users is saved to the browser's storage so that the list can continue to grow.
When that is done, the extension generates an element in the bottom right corner of the page that allows you to view the tribes.

#Installation

In order to install the Chrome extension, you must [download the chrome extension file](/Survivor Subreddit Tribe Viewer.crx?raw=true). Doing so will give you a warning about the file being potentially harmful to your computer. This is a general warning that is given about 
all .crx files. There is nothing in this extension that can harm your computer. Click *Keep* in order to complete the download.

Once the file is downloaded, open the Extensions page in Google Chrome by opening the menu and choosing *More tools* -> *Extensions*.
Once there, drag the file into the tab with the Extensions page open. The page will tell you to drop the file to install it. Drop the
file and click *Add Extension* on the dialog to install the extension. The dialog will mention that the extension has the ability to
read and modify storage on /r/Survivor. This is necessary to keep track of all of the users that have been found, as it requires saving
a list to the browser's storage. This extension will not do anything else to the browser's storage.

Once the extension is installed, the icon will appear next to the URL bar in Chrome. Now, whenever you visit /r/Survivor the extension
will run. If you want to disable or remove the extension, right click the icon by the URL bar and choose the appropriate action.
